# RedditBookmarks
A python script that exports your reddit saved links to an HTML file for importing in browsers.

As of yet you need the struc.html file along with the .py. This will change shortly. 

To use this script you need to go on Reddit, preferences/apps/create app/script and create a praw.ini file with the info you filled out.

Like so : ![praw.ini](http://i.imgur.com/0GL2MIr.png)

Then just run the script and you will get your bookmarks as an HTML file!
